In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used

### Potential Buyer prediction
**Code:** [`User click Prediction.ipynb`](https://github.com/Rohan-Birwadkar/Python-Machine-Learning/User Click Prediction/Files/User Click Prediction.ipynb)    
**Description:** Advertising data set includes details of an internet user with each features describing something about their behaviour on the internet. The main focus here is to use all the available information and somehow determine whether or not a particular user clicked on an Advertisement on the website. So the idea is to create a model that will predict whether or not a user clicks on an ad based on the features of that user.  
**Skills:** descriptive statistics, data visualization, Predictive model - Linear Regression.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.  
**Results:** User behaviour analysiss, data-based output prediction.
